##### 46.0
- (alpha03) Updated Moquette version
- (alpha03) Build: Only push back the documentation back to the dev branch when doing stable version builds.  The dev documentation is actually the one referenced by search engines (we have no control) 
- Templates and documents
  - All the supplied Excel templates are now .xlsx by default.  As a consequence, all the Excel files produced from the default templates are also in .xlsx format.  The .xslx format is directly recognized by Office, LibreOffice, Google Sheets and Microsoft 365 Web. 
  - Your existing .xls templates will work as before, but we recommend updating your local templates to .xlsx format.
  - The mechanism used for Excel downloads has changed.  Microsoft Edge has special options for modern Office document formats such as `.xlsx`.  Without the change, some downloads of `.xslx` files would fail when using Edge's "open immediately" option.
- Usability: the down signal is shown a little bit longer on all the boards (including publicresults)
