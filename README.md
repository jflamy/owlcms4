# OWLCMS - Olympic Weightlifting Competition Management System 
This software is a complete rewrite of `owlcms` which has been used to manage Olympic Weightlifting competitions since 2009. This 4<sup>th</sup> generation of the software uses up-to-date technologies to run both on local machines (Windows, Linux, Mac) or in the cloud (Heroku, Kubernetes)
