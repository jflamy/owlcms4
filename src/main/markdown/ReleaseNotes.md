37.2.0-alpha00:

- 37. 2 Enhancements
  
  - MQTT server now embedded in owlcms. There is no longer a need to run a separate one. 
    - See [embedded MQTT Server configuration documentation](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/MQTT)
  
    - **NOTE**: if you were using MQTT in earlier releases, you likely have have an OWLCMS_MQTTSERVER environment variable or have used the -DmqttServer system property definition. You should now remove them, otherwise owlcms will continue to use these variables to locate an external MQTT server.  On  Windows check the `owlcms.l4j.ini` file in the installation directory.
  
- 37.2 Fixes
  
  - none.


##### Highlights from recent stable releases

- The announcer and marshal screens show the 6 attempts and total for each athlete. ([#525](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/issues/525))
- Migration to the most recent version of the Vaadin user interface framework. The navigation (menu, top menu bar) has been redone to use officially supported components.
- There is now a separate page for pre-competition documents. There are now separate documents for each purpose instead of multiple tabs. See [Pre-Competition Documents Documentation](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/2400PreCompetitionDocuments).
- Customization of team points. Templates for the final results package now have an extra tab that contains the points awarded for each rank. Copy and rename the template if you need to change the point system for a given competition.
- Capability to add flags and athlete pictures on the attempt board (#508).  See [Flags and Pictures](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/FlagsPicture) documentation.
- Improvements to Records eligibility. See [Records Eligibility](https://${env.REPO_OWNER}.github.io/${env.O_REPO_NAME}/#/Records) documentation. 
- New Weigh-in template to create an empty Weigh-in Summary (used to facilitate data entry)
- New Sinclair coefficients for the 2024 Olympiad.  An option on the Competition rules page allows using the previous (2020 Olympiad) values if your local rules require them.  Masters SMF and SMHF use the 2020 Olympiad values until further notice.
