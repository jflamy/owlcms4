> - **Alpha releases are not normally used in actual competitions.**

- Preliminary releases change log
  - (alpha03) Sessions page: to reduce observed user confusion, added an "Edit Details" button next to "Edit Athletes".
  - (alpha03) Fix empty protocol download button to use the correct template (vs weigh-in form)
  - (alpha02) Translations (ru)
  - (alpha02) Apply fix for spurious "out-of-competition" attempt board marker from 51.0.4
  - (alpha02) Apply fix for registration file import from 51.0.3
  - (alpha01) Initial version of redesigned Documents page
- Documents: complete redesign of the Documents page
  - All documents needed to prepare and run the competition are here (Results are still on their own page).
  - The Competition-wide documents such as the Start List are handled as in the previous versions.
  - Documents like the Athlete Cards can be produced for one or more sessions.  If more than one session is selected, a zip file is produced, otherwise the Excel is produced.
  - Document sets can be produced, for example, a weigh-in form together with the cards.  When a document set is selected, a zip file is produced. The document set can be produced for one or more sessions.
  - If more than one copy of a document is needed (for example, two weigh-in forms for each session), you can adjust your template by duplicating the tab.  Same for jury forms if you want to avoid printing 3 copies manually.
