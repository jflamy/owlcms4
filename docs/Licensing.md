## Licensing

This is free, as-is, no warranty *whatsoever* software. If you just want to run it as is for your own club or federation, just download from the [Releases](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/releases) page and go ahead.  The software is meant to comply with current IWF Technical Competition Rules and Regulations (TCRR) and with the current Masters Weightlifting rules.  TCRR Requirements regarding equipment are outside our scope (such as the presence of indicator lights and buzzers on refereeing devices, etc.)You should perform your own tests to see if the software is fit for your own purposes and circumstances.

If you wish to provide or host the software as a service to others (whether you charge a fee for that service or not), the license *requires* you to make full sources building instructions available for free.  If you host the software as is, the information in the About page is sufficient to meet the requirement.  If however you modify the code, you are **required** to make the code to your modified version and the building instructions available for free to the users of your service.  The intent of the [License](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) is that anyone who wants to compile or further modify your version can do so on their own, for free, and not be tied to your services unless they choose to.  You may contact the author to seek alternative licensing agreements.Reporting Issues and Suggesting Enhancements
