Prior to a competition, several documents need to be produced

- During the Registration period and until verification of final entries, the competition secretary may use documents to cross-check registration data and confirm information with the registrants.

  - Checking that all athletes are in the [correct category](#categories-list) or categories

  - Checking [team membership](#team-membership-list) if team points are assigned
- Prior to the competition day

  - Producing a [**Start List**](#start-list) . The start list is produced several days before the competition and updated after the verification of final entries (VFE)
  - Producing the [Official's Group Assignments](#officials-schedule)
  - Producing [**Athlete Cards**](#athlete-cards) and Weigh-In Forms.  These are printed before the weigh-in, often the day before.


These steps are performed from the `Prepare Competition` page, selecting the `Documents` button

## Documents Page

![15](nimg/2400PreCompetitionDocuments/15.png)

The page has two sections.  The top section includes buttons to print the various documents.  The bottom section is used to select sessions.

- The documents in the top two lines (Entries and Pre-Competition) are global for a competition.
- The documents in the bottom two lines are typically produced for one or more sessions at a time.  The sessions are selected using the checkboxes in the bottom section.

### Multi-Session Documents and Document Sets

- An Excel is produced if you select a single session and click on a specific document.
- However, a zip will be produced when more than one session is selected -- each session document will be a separate entry in the zip.  The zip is then downloaded.  On Windows, if you use "Extract All"  (right-click on the zip file) you can use the `print.ps1` script to print all the documents to your default printer (right-click on the script and select "Run using PowerShell".)
- If you use the "Document Set" option, all the documents for which you selected a template will be included in the zip.  The typical use of "Document Set" is to produce both the weigh-in form and the athlete cards together. If you select several sessions, the documents will be created for the selected sessions.

## Start List

The start list (or starting list) shows all the athletes that will compete, in which group, and the order in which the athletes will be weighed in.  When you click on the start list button, you are given a choice of templates to use according to the paper format and whether or not you want the platform information to be visible.

## Athlete Cards

Athlete Cards are the cards that will be used by the Marshall to record changes.  The `Cards` Template is meant to be similar to the IWF format. Each page is folded in half, so that one side is snatch, the other is the clean & jerk.  Normally the start number box at the the top left is empty.  The start numbers are written by hand, with a red marker, after the weigh-in data has been entered into the system.

You can produce the cards for one or more sessions.  

- If you do NOT select sessions in the bottom section, and have less than 100 athletes, you can produce the cards as a single Excel, but depending on your system this can be slow.
- If you select multiple sessions, a zip file is produced with the different sessions.
- You can combine the athlete cards with the weigh-in form in a single zip by using the "Document Set" button.

### Challenge Cards

Challenge cards are printed from the same menu as Athlete Cards, by selecting the Challenge template instead.

## Categories List

The Categories List is a variation on the Start List that is useful before allocating groups.  It shows which athletes have registered in which category.

## Team Membership List

The Teams also includes a tab for who is registered for which club, allowing coaches to spot errors in spelling or in categories.  In addition, when a team points competition is held, the teams in which the athlete participates are shown.  

In the example below, there are 3 women in the F team and 3 men in the M team.  In a competition with multiple age groups, a single athlete can potentially score points in multiple teams (for example, as a JR and as a SR).  The team membership column will then show the teams where the athlete has been selected.

The Officials buttons creates a summary of all the officials assigned to each group.
