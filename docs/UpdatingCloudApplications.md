Installing the Heroku cloud application is very simple.  Clicking on a button tells Heroku to grab a given version of the software and deploy it.  Unfortunately, Heroku does not provide a way to get the current version easily.

But rest easy.  owlcms provides a simple application to update your Heroku applications to the current version. Running this application will connect to your Heroku account and compare your application versions with the latest available.  It uses the Heroku programming interface to tell Heroku where to find the most current version and tells it to deploy that version.

- Stable versions are updated to the latest stable version
- Pre-release versions, if you installed one, will be updated to the latest pre-release.

The application is a simple download, and runs on your own machine  (it remote controls Heroku). The application is available for Windows, Linux and Mac.  Please see https://github.com/owlcms/owlcms4-heroku-updater for details.
