## Medals

In order to have a smooth medal ceremony, printing out the medals is recommended.  The process is the same as for the protocol sheet.

The resulting Excel shows all medals in the Bronze, Silver, Gold order.  Whether there are medals for all lifts or just the total is controlled on the competition rules page.

## Final Package (Competition Book)

The final package contains several tabs for each of the 6 attempts, Sinclair and Robi rankings.  It also contains team scores.  The process for creating the book is the same as above.

The team ranking tabs shows the team cumulative points, and the details for each athlete at the bottom.

If you wish to sort the points table, please note that due to the way Excel works you will need to copy the table area somewhere else in the page and use the "Paste as values" option before you are able to sort it.

## Time Statistics

The time statistics Excel shows how much time was spent per lift in each group, on average.  It gives the number of athletes that can lift in an hours - if the number is 8 athletes per hour, then a 12 person group will take 90 minutes, on average.  Youth championships often go faster (9 or 10), whereas senior championships are slower (7,5 athletes per hour for example).
