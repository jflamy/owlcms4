## Video Demo 1: Solo Mode

The following video gives you a 3 minute overview of how owlcms operates.  For best viewing, use the Full Screen icon at the bottom right.

The demo is representative of a simple club meet.  A single person acts as announcer, timekeeper and marshall.  A second tablet or laptop is used in the warm-up area for athletes to follow the lifting order.

## Video Demo 2: Full Competition Setup

This second video shows how a full competition with the normal technical officials can take place.  Since all that is required for each official is a browser, this setup works just as well for a [virtual meet](VirtualOverview) held over videoconferencing.
